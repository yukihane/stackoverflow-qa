Hibernate supports both entity queries (JPQL/HQL and Criteria API) and native SQL statements. Entity queries are useful only if you need to modify the fetched entities, therefore benefiting from the automatic dirty checking mechanism.

For read-only transactions, you should fetch DTO projections because they allow you to select just as many columns as you need to fulfill a certain business use case. This has many benefits like reducing the load on the currently running Persistence Context because DTO projections don’t need to be managed.
